      "Tools in Data Science is a practical diploma level data science course at IIT Madras that teaches\npopular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production.",
      "Courses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.",
      "But one critical subject that’s rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?",
      "These tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:",

      "But isn’t this a data science course? Yes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don’t just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.",
      "In some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are, some of the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.",
      "This course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you do need programming to learn many of them.",
