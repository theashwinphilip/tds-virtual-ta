Tools in Data Science - May 2025
Tools in Data Science
is a practical diploma level data science course at IIT Madras that teaches
popular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production.
This course exposes you to real-life tools
Courses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.
But one critical subject that’s rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?
These tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:
You learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you’ll have to scrape them yourself.
You learn how to train models. But soon, you’ll just pick something from HuggingFace.
You learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a
sed
+
grep
script in minutes.
“We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You’ll have to decode the regexes yourself.”
In this course, we’ve curated the most important tools people use in data science.
Learn them well. You’ll be a
lot
more productive
than your peers.
This course is quite hard
Here’s students’ feedback:
2 out of 5 students in the Jan 2025 batch failed
It
used
to be an easy course until 2024.
#
#
#
Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible.
#
#
#
Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.
#
#
#
LLMs grade you – unpredictably.
#
#
The ROE is hard.
#
Take Graded assignment 1
to check if you’re ready for this course.
Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.
But it's probably worth it.
Here’s students’ feedback:
Course experience and farewell post
Programming skills are a pre-requisite
You need a
good
understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts.
But isn’t this a data science course?
Yes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don’t just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.
In some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are,
some
of the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.
This course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you
do
need programming to learn many of them.
If you passed, don't enroll again
The course is public, so you can always audit it.
Also, registering again for the course
does not improve marks much
.
We encourage learning by sharing
You
CAN
copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).
Why should you copy?
Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.
To learn well, understand
what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.
To learn better, teach
what you’ve learnt.
We cover 7 modules in 12 weeks
The content evolves with technology and feedback.
Track the
commit history
for changes.
Development Tools
and concepts to
build
models and apps.
Deployment Tools
and concepts to
publish
what you built.
Large Language Models
that make your work easier and your apps smarter.
Data Sourcing
to get data from the web, files, and databases.
Data Preparation
to clean up and convert the inputs to the right format.
Data Analysis
to find surprising insights in the data.
Data Visualization
to communicate those insights as visual stories.
